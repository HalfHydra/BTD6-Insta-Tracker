# BTD6 Instant Monkey Tracker

Abandoned, developed in March of 2021.

## Description

This was intended to be a tracker of an inventory in the game Bloons TD 6 that would generate the current rewards from the daily challenge feature from the game's API and present it in a pretty visual form. The intended use would be to track your inventory outside of the actual game, which I found annoying to switch back to my inventory to see if I had an instant monkey or not. In order to solve this problem, I wanted to make this tool which would prevent me from logging into the game at all if the current daily rewards did not have what I needed to complete the collection.

I spent a lot of time putting effort into the visuals for this project as well as generating from the api, but never developed the actual final display. Maybe I will finish it in the future.

## Two versions

There are two versions here. The first one is the original version which was the base of the final product. The other one is the one I used for testing the animations, and perhaps limiting the tool to just tracking outside of the game instead of generating from the API. Sample Data from the API has been included.
